           NetworkSynchronous,
           FairActions
    PROVE  \A slot \in Slots : <>(finalized # {})
PROOF
<1>1. SUFFICES ASSUME NEW slot \in Slots,
                      HonestNodes eventually vote,
                      Network delivers votes
               PROVE  <>\E hash \in Hashes : <<slot, hash>> \in finalized
      BY honest majority assumption
<1>2. Honest nodes will eventually cast consistent votes
      BY synchrony assumption and protocol logic
<1>3. 60% stake threshold will be reached
      BY <1>2 and HonestStake > 60 assumption  
<1>4. SlowFinalize will eventually trigger
      BY <1>3 and FinalStakeFor calculation
<1>5. QED BY <1>4 DEF SlowFinalize

 * LEMMA 2: Fast Path Completion
 * ============================================================================= *)

LEMMA FastPathCompletion ==
    ASSUME ResponsiveStake > 80,
           NetworkSynchronous,
           FairActions
    PROVE  \A slot \in Slots : <>\E hash \in Hashes : <<slot, hash>> \in fastFinalized
PROOF
<1>1. Responsive nodes vote quickly under synchrony
      BY ResponsiveStake and NetworkSynchronous assumptions
<1>2. 80% stake threshold achieved rapidly  
      BY <1>1 and ResponsiveStake > 80
<1>3. FastFinalize triggered before slow path
      BY <1>2 and NotarStakeFor >= 80 condition
<1>4. QED BY <1>3 DEF FastFinalize

 * LEMMA 3: Bounded Finalization Time
 * ============================================================================= *)

LEMMA BoundedFinalizationTime ==
    ASSUME HonestStake > 60,

           VotingDelay <= Epsilon
    PROVE  \A slot \in Slots, hash \in Hashes :
               <<slot, hash>> \in finalized => 
               FinalizationTime(slot, hash) <= Max(DeltaFast, 2 * DeltaSlow)
PROOF
<1>1. Fast path completes in DeltaFast time
      BY network synchrony and 80% threshold
<1>2. Slow path completes in 2 * DeltaSlow time  
      BY two-round voting and 60% threshold
<1>3. Protocol chooses minimum of both paths
      BY dual-path concurrent execution
<1>4. QED BY <1>1, <1>2, <1>3 and min() function

LEMMA EventualConsensus ==

    PROVE  <>(\A node1, node2 \in HonestNodes : 
                node1.finalized = node2.finalized)
PROOF
<1>1. Network partitions eventually heal
      BY NetworkEventuallyHeals assumption
<1>2. Honest nodes synchronize views
      BY <1>1 and protocol message exchange
<1>3. Finalized sets converge to same values
      BY <1>2 and safety properties (no conflicts)
<1>4. QED BY <1>3

 * THEOREM: Complete Liveness

THEOREM LivenessGuarantees ==
    ASSUME Spec,

                FinalizationTime(block.slot, block.hash) <= BoundedTime  \* Bounded time
PROOF
<1>1. Progress follows from ProgressUnderHonestMajority
      BY ProgressUnderHonestMajority and assumptions
<1>2. Fast completion follows from FastPathCompletion  
      BY FastPathCompletion and ResponsiveStake condition
<1>3. Bounded time follows from BoundedFinalizationTime
      BY BoundedFinalizationTime and network assumptions

           HonestStake > 60,
           Spec
    PROVE  <>(\E block : block \in finalized)
PROOF
<1>1. Byzantine and crashed stake constraints ensure honest majority
      BY arithmetic: 100 - 20 - 20 = 60 < HonestStake
<1>2. Honest majority enables progress
      BY <1>1 and ProgressUnderHonestMajority
