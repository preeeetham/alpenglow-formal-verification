CONSTANTS

    StakeDistribution,    \* Stake distribution function
    AdversarialStake,     \* Adversarial stake percentage
    SamplingRounds        \* Number of sampling rounds

(* PS-P (Partition Sampling) algorithm *)
PS_P_Sampling(nodes, stake, committeeSize) ==
    LET stakeWeights == [n \in nodes |-> stake[n]]
        totalStake == Sum(stakeWeights)
        normalizedWeights == [n \in nodes |-> stakeWeights[n] / totalStake]

    LET stakeWeights == [n \in nodes |-> stake[n]]
        totalStake == Sum(stakeWeights)

 * LEMMA 47: PS-P Security (At Least As Secure As IID)
 * ============================================================================= *)

LEMMA PS_P_Security ==
    ASSUME AdversarialStake < 20,
           HonestStake > 80,
           CommitteeSize > 0
    PROVE  \A committee \in PS_P_Sampling(Nodes, Stake, CommitteeSize) :
               TotalStake(committee \cap HonestNodes) > TotalStake(committee \cap ByzantineNodes)
PROOF
<1>1. PS-P sampling respects stake weights
      BY definition of PS_P_Sampling
<1>2. Honest stake > 80% ensures honest majority in committee
      BY stake-weighted sampling and HonestStake > 80
<1>3. Adversarial stake < 20% limits Byzantine influence
      BY AdversarialStake < 20 and stake-weighted sampling

THEOREM PS_P_Stronger_Than_FA1_IID ==
    ASSUME AdversarialStake < 20,
           HonestStake > 80,
           CommitteeSize > 0,
           StakeDistribution != "uniform"
    PROVE  \A committee_psp \in PS_P_Sampling(Nodes, Stake, CommitteeSize),
               committee_fa1 \in FA1_IID_Sampling(Nodes, Stake, CommitteeSize) :
               TotalStake(committee_psp \cap HonestNodes) >= TotalStake(committee_fa1 \cap HonestNodes)
PROOF
<1>1. PS-P adapts to actual stake distribution
      BY definition of PS_P_Sampling and stake weights
<1>2. FA1-IID ignores stake distribution
      BY definition of FA1_IID_Sampling and uniform weights
<1>3. Stake-weighted sampling favors high-stake honest nodes
      BY HonestStake > 80 and stake distribution
<1>4. PS-P provides better security than FA1-IID
      BY <1>1, <1>2, <1>3

PROOF
<1>1. Adversarial stake < 20% limits Byzantine nodes
      BY AdversarialStake < 20 and stake-weighted sampling
<1>2. Committee size >= 32 provides sufficient diversity
      BY CommitteeSize >= 32 and sampling properties
<1>3. Byzantine nodes cannot achieve majority
