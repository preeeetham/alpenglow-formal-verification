      BY definition of crash failure
<1>2. Available stake = 100 - CrashedStake > 80
      BY CrashedStake < 20 assumption

PROOF
<1>1. During partition, each side may make progress independently
      BY partition assumption and local majority
<1>2. CASE Both sides have sufficient honest stake
      <2>1. Both sides may finalize different blocks
            BY independent operation during partition
      <2>2. After partition heals, conflicting views exist
            BY <2>1
      <2>3. Safety properties prevent conflicting finalizations
            BY SafetyProofs!NoConflictingFinalizations
      <2>4. CONTRADICTION BY <2>2, <2>3
      <2>5. Therefore, at most one side can make progress
            BY proof by contradiction
<1>3. CASE Only one side has sufficient honest stake  
      <2>1. Only that side can finalize blocks
            BY stake requirements
      <2>2. Other side makes no progress during partition
            BY insufficient stake
      <2>3. After healing, non-progressing side adopts finalized blocks
            BY protocol synchronization rules
<1>4. After partition heals, nodes synchronize
      BY network healing and message propagation

PROOF
<1>1. Equivocating votes have same (node, slot) but different hashes
      BY definition of equivocation
<1>2. Honest nodes receive both conflicting votes eventually
      BY network assumptions and gossip protocol
<1>3. Honest nodes compare votes by same node for same slot
      BY protocol verification logic
